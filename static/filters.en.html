	<h2>Search Filters</h2>
	<hr />
	<p>Search filters are an easy way to narrow down a listing of
		records to quickly find the one(s) you need.</p>
	<p>At the top of each column, you will typically see either a text box
		or a dropdown list of options.  These are called filters.  When you
		enter data into one or more filters and click the "Filter" button, the table
		will return only data that matches the filters.</p>
	<p>Dropdown lists are easy -- just select the option you want to view, or
		a blank for all records.</p>
	<p>Text fields have slightly more control.  For example, imagine you're
		searching for a user with the last name "Doe".  If you type "Doe" into
		the filter in the Last Name column, the table will return all last names
		that contain "doe" anywhere in them (eg, "Doeson", "Podadoe", etc).  If
		you only want to see names that exactly match "Doe", you can prefix your
		search with the <tt>=</tt> sign, eg, <tt>=Doe</tt>. Likewise, if you want
		to see columns that <em>don't</em> exactly match "Doe", you can use
		the <tt>!=</tt> operator, eg, <tt>!=Doe</tt>.</p>
	<p>This can work with numbers as well.  If you have a "Total" field, you
		can search for all totals greater than 100 by entering <tt>&gt;100</tt> in the
		filter.  Likewise, you can search for totals less than 100 by entering
		<tt>&lt;100</tt>.  You can also use <tt>&gt;=</tt> and <tt>&lt;=</tt>
		if needed.  If you want to find rows with total equal to 100,
		use <tt>=100</tt>.</p>
	<p>You can search a number or date field by range as well.  Just enter the
	lower and upper bounds of your range with a <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> between
	them.  For example, to find all rows with a field between 10 and 20, use
	<tt>10&lt;&gt;20</tt>.  To find all rows with a date in the year 2007, use
	<tt>2007-01-01&lt;&gt;2007-12-31</tt>.</p>
