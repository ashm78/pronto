- Make build_form(), build_tabbed_form(), and the ajaxForm() JS stuff all
	use the same behaviour when generating submit buttons, including
	the spinner graphic and the relative positioning.

- Let modules manage their own navigation config as they do with URL routes.

- Create a robust logging facility for debugging and reporting.

- Rewrite DB_Base to follow standard Pronto coding styles

- Move towards a more agnostic-RDBMS approach:
	- Make the CRUD generator work with other RDBMS

- SECURITY: Use some authenticastion with the ajaxfilemanager tinymce
	plugin.  At present, anyone can upload files to /img/content using
	it.
