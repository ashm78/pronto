- Make build_form(), build_tabbed_form(), and the ajaxForm() JS stuff all
	use the same behaviour when generating submit buttons, including
	the spinner graphic and the relative positioning.

- Rewrite DB_Base to follow standard Pronto coding styles

- Move towards a more agnostic-RDBMS approach:
	- Make the CRUD generator work with other RDBMS
